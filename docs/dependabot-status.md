# Dependabot status

_Last updated: 2026-10-09. Maintained during the Dependabot clean-up pass; update when the state changes._

## Configuration

- Ecosystems covered: npm (`/`, the Expo app), github-actions (`/`).
- Grouping: `minor-and-patch` for both ecosystems (open-PR limit 5 each).
- Schedule: weekly.
- Ignore rules: `expo`/`expo-*` majors (move with the SDK, currently 57); `react`, `react-native`, `@types/react`, `@react-native/*` majors and minors (chosen by the Expo SDK); `typescript` and `eslint` majors (the eslint-config-expo toolchain does not load under TS 7 / ESLint 10).

## State at last update

- Open Dependabot PRs: 0 (each merged or closed only after reading its checks).
- Default-branch CI: green at last check.
- Last full rescan: 2026-10-09. Checked open PRs (none), default-branch and scheduled CI, Dependabot update jobs, ecosystem coverage (no new manifests since 2026-10-08), Actions pins, exemption expiry dates and stray branches, plus three new dimensions: branch-protection required contexts against the check runs a PR actually produces, the repo's `security_and_analysis` settings, and check-run annotations on `main`. No required context is stale. The annotations showed `ubuntu-latest` moving to Ubuntu 26 from 2026-10-19, so every job is now pinned to `ubuntu-24.04` (see Notes). The full-history gitleaks scan was not repeated: the only commits since 2026-10-08 are docs and CI changes, each scanned by the push-run gitleaks job. Rescan cycle 2 (same day, after those pins merged) repeated every dimension and added one: each repo's `SECURITY.md` and whether GitHub private vulnerability reporting is enabled.

## Time-limited exemptions

- `scripts/check-npm-audit.mjs` allowlist: `node-forge` (GHSA-86w9-cpqp-85rv) and `braces` (GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm), both transitive via Expo build tooling, `expires` 2026-11-15; the check fails outright after that date.

## Notes

- `npm install`/`npm ci` need `--legacy-peer-deps` for this SDK 57 tree.
- The repo's default branch is `main` (checked through the API on 2026-10-08), and `claude/pulsewatch-mobile-rebuild-wab4mn` no longer exists. The older note about switching it is resolved.
- Every workflow declares a top-level `permissions: contents: read` (added 2026-10-08, rescan cycle 3). Jobs that need more, such as CodeQL's `security-events: write`, declare it at job level.
- Merge policy (deliberate choice by the repo owner, 2026-10-08): every PR, major-version dependency bumps included, is merged as soon as all of its required checks are green, confirmed per PR. This repo is a code showcase with no business or sensitive dependency, so green checks are the only gate. Red, pending or conflicted PRs are fixed or closed instead.
- Every Linux job runs on `ubuntu-24.04` (pinned 2026-10-09; it is what `ubuntu-latest` resolved to). GitHub moves `ubuntu-latest` to Ubuntu 26 from 2026-10-19, and an unattended image change could turn every check red at once. Move to `ubuntu-26.04` deliberately, in one PR whose CI has run on it. Dependabot does not bump `runs-on` labels.
- `SECURITY.md` added 2026-10-09 (rescan cycle 2: the repo had no security policy). It sends reporters to GitHub private vulnerability reporting, which is disabled here. Enabling it needs the Administration permission on the owner's token; escalation requested 2026-10-09.

## Deferred (not re-raised each pass)

- Ignored major versions are listed in `.github/dependabot.yml` with the reason for each.
- Re-check exemptions before their `effectiveUntil` date (2026-11-15) and drop them once upstream fixes ship.
- Alerts read 2026-10-09 with the repo owner's PAT, run on their machine (Claude sessions still get 403: the proxy sends a GitHub App token instead of `GH_ALERTS_TOKEN`, even a PAT passed explicitly). No open Dependabot or code-scanning alerts.
