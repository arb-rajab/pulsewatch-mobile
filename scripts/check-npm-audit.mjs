/**
 * Runs `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` but allows a small,
 * explicitly dated allowlist of advisory IDs to pass through instead of
 * failing the build — used only for a finding that's confirmed:
 *   (a) real (not a false positive),
 *   (b) dev/build-tooling only, never shipped in the app bundle, and
 *   (c) has no upstream fix available yet.
 *
 * This is NOT a permanent suppression. Every entry has an `expires` date;
 * once that date passes, this script fails loudly on that entry regardless
 * of whether it's still "just" the allowlisted finding, forcing a human to
 * either renew the allowlist (re-confirming (a)-(c) still hold) or drop it
 * because upstream finally shipped a fix. See README's "Known issues" for
 * the full story on the >high-severity moderate findings this doesn't
 * touch at all (those stay below --audit-level=high and are unaffected by
 * this script).
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-npm-audit.mjs
 * Exit 0: no findings at/above --audit-level, or every one is allowlisted
 *         and not expired.
 * Exit 1: a real, non-allowlisted high/critical finding, or an allowlist
 *         entry past its expiry date.

// `npm audit --json` propagates severity up the WHOLE dependency chain: if
// leaf package D has a real advisory, every package that depends on it
// (C -> B -> A) also gets its own top-level entry in `vulnerabilities`, and
// that entry's `severity` field is the MAX severity of every advisory
// reachable anywhere below it — not necessarily the severity of any single
// advisory. C/B/A's own `via` arrays list the next package DOWN the chain as
// a plain package-name *string*, not the advisory object; only the actual
// leaf advisory entries are objects with a `url` AND THEIR OWN `severity`.
//
// This matters concretely in this repo: `uuid`'s real advisory
// (GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq) is a long-documented MODERATE (6.3) finding — one of
// the 13 moderate findings README's "Known issues" already accepts and that
// `--audit-level=high` is specifically scoped to ignore. It was never
// supposed to need an allowlist entry. But `uuid` and `node-forge` (the real
// high-severity, allowlisted finding) both sit transitively under the same
// `@expo/cli`/`expo` package entries, so npm audit's rolled-up severity for
// `@expo/cli`/`expo` is "high" (the max of the two), and a check that only
// looked at the rolled-up container severity would wrongly treat `uuid`'s
// advisory as something that needs allowlisting too, when its own severity
// never crossed the --audit-level=high threshold at all.
//
// So: walk the WHOLE report and collect every leaf advisory object (the ones
// with their own `url` + `severity`), deduped by url. Only a leaf whose OWN
// severity is high/critical needs an allowlist entry — a moderate leaf
// dragged into a "high" container by an unrelated sibling advisory does not.
